# Makai Tic Tac Toe GUI

## Description
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). It allows two players to take turns clicking on a grid to place their X or O. The game provides a basic 3x3 grid and keeps track of player turns. It also checks for a winner after each turn and allows starting a new game.

- Check Winner: Checks for a winner after each turn and displays a message if there's a winner.
- Reset Game: Provides a "New Game" button to reset the grid for a new game.

## Technical Requirements
- GUI application built using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT).
- Code hosted on GitHub repository.
- Includes a README file documenting the features of the application and providing instructions on how to run the game.
